# CLAUDE.md — Contribution Rules

This file defines the rules for maintaining and updating this repository.
Follow these guidelines in every session without needing to be reminded.

---

## Repository Purpose

A centralized map of references for configuring AI coding assistants.
Covers: skills, instructions, prompts, agents, rules, SDD tools and AI coding assistants.

**This is a map — not a catalog.**
We point to repos and resources, we do not host skills or prompts directly.
Only add resources that are specifically about configuring AI coding assistants.
Do NOT add: AI frameworks, ML libraries, models, papers or general AI tools.

## Tags

Only add a tag when official support is **confirmed**. Do not guess.

**Always use image badges from `BADGES.md` — never plain text tags.**
